midas_play.py contains a simple inferencing pipeline for generating the depth images given an RGB image. We consider 13 images and generate their respective depth images using MiDaS model -- the commented lines contain some pretty useful explanaions on each step performed! do checkout!

getting started with depth estimation transformer models- MiDas small. With sample input images -- and their respective output images! Now lookinto the change in gradients along y axis to diffeentiate between an obstacle or a clear path/ floor
